## About

Does money grow (on) trees? Trees and other plants are known to have a natural cooling effect ([Shashua-Bar & Hoffman, 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778899000183)). For this reason, trees are often used in urban areas to reduce temperatures and the effects of climate change.

## Read in data for New York City census tracts

```{r}
nyc <- get_acs(
  state = "NY",
  county = c("Bronx", "Kings", "New York", "Richmond", "Queens"),
  geography = "tract",
  variables = "B19013_001",
  geometry = TRUE,
  year = 2015
)


# Read in tree data
nyc_trees <- read_csv(here('data/2015StreetTreesCensus_TREES.csv'))

# Check the different status' of the trees
unique(nyc_trees$status)

#  Filter to trees that are alive
nyc_trees_alive <- nyc_trees %>% 
  filter(status == "Alive")
```

```{r}
# Add new column to nyc that calculate the area for each census tract
nyc <- nyc %>%
  mutate(area_km2 = as.numeric(st_area(geometry)/1e6))

nyc$income <- (nyc$estimate/10000)

# Map income by census tract
mapview(nyc,
        zcol = "income",
        layer.name = "Median income ($10,000)")

```

```{r}
# Make trees data set into sf object and set crs to match
nyc_trees_sf <- st_as_sf(nyc_trees_alive, coords = c("longitude", "Latitude"), crs = st_crs(nyc))

# Join trees and income by st_within and count trees in each census tract
nyc_trees_income <- nyc_trees_sf %>% 
  st_join(nyc, join = st_within) %>% 
  group_by(GEOID) %>% 
  summarize(tree_count = n())

# Add tree count data back to income data
treecount_income <- st_join(nyc, nyc_trees_income) %>% 
  select(-c('GEOID.x', 'GEOID.y'))

# Add tree per km2 column
treecount_income <- treecount_income %>% 
  mutate(tree_per_km2 = (tree_count/area_km2))

# Map trees per km2
mapview(treecount_income,
        zcol = "tree_per_km2",
        layer.name = "trees per square kilometer")
```

```{r}

# Residuals

```{r}
